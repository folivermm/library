## Achievements

Throughout the development of this project, we've achieved the following milestones:

- Successfully working with large datasets and creating algorithms based on these datasets.
- Proficiency in differentiating between various JavaScript error types and effectively resolving issues using error messages.
- Understanding the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var`, and using them appropriately within the codebase.
- Implementing arrays from strings based on specific criteria and efficiently joining arrays into strings.
- Incorporating expressions into strings using template literals for cleaner and more dynamic code.
- Utilizing array methods such as `sort()`, `reduce()`, `find()`, `filter()`, `map()`, `some()`, and `every()` to address diverse problems.
- Implementing helper functions to enhance code modularity and reusability.
- Applying advanced JavaScript concepts such as the ternary operator, spread operator, object shorthand, array or object destructuring, and `for/in` loops.
